# Logs Management Documentation

This directory contains log files generated by the server application. Proper management and interpretation of these logs are crucial for monitoring the server's performance and troubleshooting issues.

## Log File Formats

The log files are generated in a structured format, typically in plain text or JSON. Each log entry includes a timestamp, log level (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR), and a message describing the event.

## Common Log Levels

- **INFO**: General information about the application's operation.
- **WARNING**: Indicates a potential issue that should be monitored.
- **ERROR**: An error occurred that needs immediate attention.

## Managing Log Files

1. **Viewing Logs**: Use command-line tools like `cat`, `less`, or `tail` to view log files.
   - Example: `tail -f /path/to/logfile.log` to view logs in real-time.

2. **Rotating Logs**: Implement log rotation to manage disk space. This can be done using tools like `logrotate`.

3. **Archiving Logs**: Regularly archive old log files to prevent clutter and maintain performance.

## Troubleshooting Steps

- If you encounter issues, check the log files for ERROR entries.
- Look for patterns in WARNING entries that may indicate underlying problems.
- Ensure that the logging configuration is set correctly in the server configuration file.
